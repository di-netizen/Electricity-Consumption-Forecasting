### üîç Features

- **Data Simulation**: Generates one year of synthetic weather and electricity usage records, with a weekend consumption boost.  
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Line and box plots to inspect trends and seasonal patterns.  
- **Model Training**: Splits data, trains a Random Forest regressor, evaluates performance, and persists the model.  
- **Inference**: Simple script to load the model and predict next-day electricity consumption.  
- **Evaluation**: Overlay of actual vs. predicted consumption for comprehensive performance review.
